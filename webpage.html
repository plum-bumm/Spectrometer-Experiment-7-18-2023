  <h3> Data Analysis </h3>
  <p> The experiment showed that the folder we tested was orange due to the percent reflectance of the folder spiking during wavelengths associated with warmer tones (585 nm-700 nm), while wavelengths associated with cooler tones (470 nm-560 nm) were much lower in comparison. Percent reflectance is found through the equation: </p>
  <p>
    % reflectance= (color measurement-dark standard)/(calibration-dark standard)*100 </p>
  <p>
    The dark standard/dark voltage was the first measurement we took, which is the reading that the spectrometer read before being exposed to any color. The spectrometer was put up against a dark surface in order to zero out the machine and gain the correct percentages once we inserted our data into the calculation above. Our calibration was next, where we measured each color/wavelength on a white piece of paper for a sense of the intensity of the different wavelengths in comparison to our data when pointed at the orange folder, which is our color measurement. </p>
  <p>
    When recording our color measurement, the color Blue (470 nm) was lower than our dark voltage, leading to concerns. Once we compared our data to another group, we noticed that there was no other negative percent reflectance. This led to us using another machine to ensure our data would be correct. </p>

  <h3> Data Analysis </h3>
  <p> Using a different spectrometer, we followed the same procedures to gain data as Figure 1.1 and used that data to redo our calculations for the percent reflectance. Once the calculations were complete, no negative number was calculated. While comparing the two graphs, the same general trend was shown with the percent reflectance being low for cooler colors (470 nm- 560 nm) then the warmer colors (585 nm-700 nm.) </p>
